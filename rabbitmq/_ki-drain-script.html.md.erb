- **On-demand-adapter does not cleanly exit the drain script when the credentials are not present in UAA.**
The drain script is expected to output an integer to determine success (0) or failure (non-zero).
In some cases, the drain script outputs errors even though the operation has succeeded.
This causes a failure in the drain operation.
This is fixed in v1.20.1.
