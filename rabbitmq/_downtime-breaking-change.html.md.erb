<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>
Upgrading to this RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu [VMs] release causes cluster <strong>downtime</strong>.
This is because the RabbitMQ cluster is taken offline when nodes are upgraded to Erlang v21.
<br><br>
Instead of upgrading to this release, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends upgrading to RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu [VMs] v1.17.3 or later.
Upgrading to RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu [VMs] v1.17.3 or later uses rolling upgrades.
This does not take the cluster offline when nodes are upgraded to Erlang v21.
