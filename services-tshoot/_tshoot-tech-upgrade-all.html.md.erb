<p>
	The <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand does the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Collects all of the service instances that the on-demand broker has registered.</li>
	<li> Issues an upgrade command to the on-demand broker, regenerates the service instance 
		manifest based on the latest configuration from the tile, deploys the new manifest for 
		the service instance, and waits for this operation to complete, then proceeds to the next instance.
	</li>
	<li>Adds to a retry list any instances that have ongoing BOSH tasks at the time of upgrade. 
		Retries any instances in the retry list until all instances are upgraded.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	When you make changes to the plan configuration, 
	upgrade all the <%= vars.product_short %> service instances to the latest version of the plan.
</p>

<p>
	If any instance fails to upgrade, the errand fails immediately.
	This prevents systemic problems from spreading to the rest of your service instances.
