<p>
	The <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand does the following:
</p>

<ol class="about-broker">
	<li>Collects all of the service instances that the on-demand broker has registered.</li>
	<li>For each instance the errand does the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Issues an upgrade command to the on-demand broker.</li>
			<li>Regenerates the service instance manifest based on the latest configuration from the tile.</li>
			<li>Deploys the new manifest for the service instance.</li>
			<li>Waits for this operation to complete, then proceeds to the next instance.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Adds to a retry list any instances that have ongoing BOSH tasks at the time of upgrade.</li>
	<li>Retries any instances in the retry list until all instances are upgraded.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	When you make changes to the plan configuration, 
	upgrade all the <%= vars.product_short %> service instances to the latest version of the plan.
</p>

<p>
	If any instance fails to upgrade, the errand fails immediately.
	This prevents systemic problems from spreading to the rest of your service instances.
