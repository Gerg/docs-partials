<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  Before you individually upgrade service instances you must have cf CLI v6.46.0 or later.
</p>

You can use `cf update-service` with the `--upgrade` flag to individually upgrade service instances to
the latest version of <%= vars.product_short %>.
When you upgrade a service instance, you do not need to rebind your app or service keys.
However, when you upgrade a service instance the
<% if vars.product_short.include?("MySQL") %>database is unavailable for several minutes.
<% else %>the RabbitMQ nodes are updated serially and are therefore unavailable one node at a time.<% end %>

For more information about using `cf update-service`,
see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/update-service.html).

To upgrade a single service instance:

1. Confirm that an upgrade is available for the service instance by running:

    ```
    cf services
    ```

    The upgrade is available when the `upgrade available` column in the output says `yes`.

    For example:

    <% if vars.product_short.include?("MySQL") %>
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf services
    Getting services in org system / space system as admin...

    name         service    plan      bound apps  last operation    broker                  upgrade available
    my-instance  p.mysql    db-small              create succeeded  dedicated-mysql-broker  yes
    </pre>
    <% else %>
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf services
    Getting services in org system / space system as admin...

    name         service     plan         bound apps  last operation    broker                     upgrade available
    my-instance  p.rabbitmq  single-node              create succeeded  dedicated-rabbitmq-broker  yes
    </pre>
    <% end %><%# Check if this RabbitMQ snippet is accurate %>

1. Upgrade the service instance by running:

    ```
    cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --upgrade
    ```

1. When prompted, confirm that you want to upgrade.
