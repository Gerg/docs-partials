<p class=note>
  <strong>Note:</strong> For developers to be able to upgrade individual service
  instances, you must use <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> v2.7 or later.
</p>

After you upgrade the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, existing service instances must be upgraded to
use the latest version of the tile.
Developers cannot create new bindings to service instances that have not been upgraded.

To decrease runtime for service instance upgrades, developers can individually upgrade
on-demand service instances using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
Developers can upgrade individual service instances by following the procedure in
<% if vars.product_short.include?("MySQL") %>
[Upgrade an Individual Service Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-8/use.html#single).
<% else %>
[Upgrade an Individual Service Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/use.html#individual-upgrades).
<% end %>

Developers can only upgrade individual service instances if you disable the `upgrade-all-service-instances`
errand when upgrading the tile.
By default, <%= vars.product_short %> runs this errand when you upgrade the tile.
However, this operation can take a long time.
<% if vars.product_short.include?("MySQL") %>
You must also ensure that the `register-broker` errand is run during upgrades.
For more information about the `register broker` errand, see [register-broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-8/errands.html#register-broker).
<% else %>
You must also ensure that the **Register On Demand Service Broker** errand is run during upgrades.
For how to enable and disable errands, see [Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/install-config.html#errands).
