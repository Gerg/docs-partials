<p class=note><strong>Note:</strong> For developers to be able to upgrade individual service
  instances, you must use <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> v2.7 or later.
</p>

To decrease runtime for service instance upgrades, developers can individually upgrade service
instances.
Developers can only upgrade a service instance if you disable the `upgrade-all-service-instances`
errand when upgrading the tile.
By default, <%= vars.product_short %> runs this errand when you upgrade the tile.
However, this operation can take a long time.

After you upgrade the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, existing service instances must be upgraded to
use the latest version of the tile.
Developers cannot create new bindings to service instances that have not been upgraded.
