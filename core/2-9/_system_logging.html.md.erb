In the **System Logging** pane, you can configure system logging in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to forward log messages from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component VMs to an external service. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends forwarding logs to an external service for use in troubleshooting. If you do not fill these fields, platform logs are not forwarded but remain available on the component VMs and for download through <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This procedure explains how to configure system logging for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component VMs. To forward logs from <%= vars.platform_name %> tiles to an external service, you must also configure system logging in each tile. For more information about configuring system logging, see the documentation for the given tiles.</p>

To configure the **System Logging** pane:

1. Select **System Logging**.

1. For **Address**, enter the hostname or IP address of the syslog server.

1. For **Port**, enter the port of the syslog server. The default port for a syslog server is 514.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The host must be reachable from the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> network and accept UDP or TCP connections. Ensure the syslog server listens on external interfaces.</p>

1. For **Transport protocol**, select a transport protocol for log forwarding.

1. For **Encrypt syslog using TLS?**, select **Yes** to use TLS encryption when forwarding logs to a remote server.
  1. For **Permitted peer**, enter either the name or SHA1 fingerprint of the remote peer.
  1. For **Destination certificate**, enter the TLS CA certificate for the remote server.

1. Select the **Enable syslog egress through Syslog Agents** checkbox to use the Syslog Agent for syslog egress. Agent-based syslog provides an alternative to scalable-syslog architecture. For more information about the Syslog Agent, see [Loggregator Architecture and Components](../loggregator/architecture.html#components) in _Loggregator Architecture_.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Selecting this checkbox disables the Syslog Adapter and Syslog Scheduler VMs to prevent log duplication.</p>

1. Select the **Enable Cloud Controller security event logging** checkbox to include security events in the log stream. This feature logs all API requests, including the endpoint, user, source IP address, and request result, in the Common Event Format (CEF).

1. Enable the **Use TCP for file forwarding local transport** checkbox to transmit logs over TCP. This prevents log truncation, but may cause performance issues.

1. The **Do not forward debug logs** checkbox is enabled by default. To forward `DEBUG` syslog messages to an external service, disable the checkbox.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components generate a high volume of <code>DEBUG</code> syslog messages. Enabling the <strong>Do not forward debug logs</strong> checkbox prevents <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components from forwarding the <code>DEBUG</code> syslog messages to external services. However, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> still writes the messages to the local disk.</p>

1. For **Custom rsyslog configuration**, enter a custom syslog rule. For more information about adding custom syslog rules, see [Customizing Platform Log Forwarding](../customizing/custom-syslog-rules.html).

1. Select the **Enable system metrics** checkbox to emit system-level metrics about all VMs in the deployment. For a list of the VM metrics that the System Metric Agent emits, see the [system-metrics-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/system-metrics-release/blob/develop/docs/system-metrics-agent.md#vm-metrics) repository on GitHub.

1. The **Enable V1 Firehose** checkbox is disabled by default.
   Select this checkbox to enable logs and metrics to flow to the Loggregator V1 Firehose.

1. The **Enable V2 Firehose** checkbox is enabled by default.
   Clear this checkbox to prevent logs and metrics from flowing to the Loggregator V2 Firehose.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you deselect this checkbox to disable the V2 Firehose,
           you must also disable the V1 Firehose.
        </p>
	<div class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> If you disable the V2 Firehose, you must select the <strong>Enable Log Cache syslog ingestion</strong> checkbox, or logs and metrics do not appear in Log Cache. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you do not disable the Firehose if you are dependent on any of these:
		<ul>
			<li>Service tile metrics</li>
			<li>Pivotal Healthwatch or Pivotal App Metrics</li>
			<li>Partner log or metric integrations</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If both the V2 and V1 Firehoses are disabled,
           then disable the Smoke Test errand.
           Otherwise, the deploy fails.
           To disable errands, see <a href="#errands">Configure Errands</a>.
           </p>

1. Select the **Enable Log Cache syslog ingestion** checkbox to configure Log Cache to ingest logs and metrics through the syslog server instead of the Reverse Log Proxy. You must select this checkbox if you disable the V2 Firehose.

1. For **Aggregate log and metric drain destinations**, enter a comma-separated list of syslog endpoints for an aggregate log and metric drain. Aggregate drains forward all app logs, app metrics, and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component VM metrics on your foundation to the endpoints that you provide in this list.

1. Click **Save**.

To configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> for system logging, see [Settings Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings) in _Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Interface_.
