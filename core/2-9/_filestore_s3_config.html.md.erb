To use an external S3-compatible filestore for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> file storage:

1. Select **External S3-compatible filestore** and complete these fields:
    * Enter the `https://` **URL endpoint** for your region. For example, `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.
    * If you use an AWS instance profile to manage role information for your filestore, enable the **S3 AWS with instance profile** checkbox. For more information, see [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) in the AWS documentation.
    <br />
    <%= image_tag("images/external-s3-filestore-instance-profile.png", alt: "At the top of the image is an enabled checkbox labeled 'S3 AWS with instance profile'. Below this checkbox are two fields labeled 'Access key' and 'Secret key'. The 'Secret key' field contains the ghost text 'Secret'.", :width => "300") %>
    <% if aws == true %>
    * If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment is on AWS, you can alternatively enter the **Access key** and **Secret key** of the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-user` you created when configuring AWS for <%= vars.platform_name %>. If you enable the **S3 AWS with instance profile** checkbox and also enter an **Access key** and **Secret key**, the instance profile overrules the access key and secret key.
    <% end %>
    * From the **S3 signature version** dropdown, select **V4 signature**. For more information about S3 signatures, see [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the AWS documentation.
    * For **Region**, enter the region in which your S3 buckets are located. For example, `us-west-2`.
    * Select **Server-side encryption** to encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore. This option is only available for AWS S3.
    * (Optional) If you selected **Server-side encryption**, you can also specify a **KMS key ID**. <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses the KMS key to encrypt files uploaded to the blobstore. If you do not provide a KMS Key ID, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses the default AWS key. For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the AWS documentation.
    * Clear the **Path Style S3 URLs (deprecated)** checkbox.
      This means that the S3 bucket is accessed using the virtual-hosted model
      instead of the old path-based model.
      You must deselect this checkbox before AWS removes the old path-based model on September 30, 2020.
      For information about S3 path deprecation, see the [Amazon news
      blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/).

    <%= image_tag("images/path-style-s3-urls-deprecated.png", alt: "The Path Style S3 URLs (deprecated) is enabled by default", :width => "300") %>

    * Configure these checkboxes depending on whether your S3 buckets have versioning enabled:
      * For versioned S3 buckets, enable the **Use versioning for backup and restore** checkbox to archive each bucket to a version.
      * For unversioned S3 buckets, disable the **Use versioning for backup and restore** checkbox, and enter a backup bucket name for each active bucket. The backup bucket name must be different from the name of the active bucket it backs up.<br>
