(Optional) The default value for the **App network maximum transmission unit** field is `1454`. Some configurations, such as networks that use GRE tunnels, may require a smaller MTU value. To change this value, enter your desired MTU value in bytes.
For Azure environments we recommend setting this to `1400` or lower to prevent Azure from fragmenting the packets as per [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-tcpip-performance-tuning).
