To add an older cipher suite to the Gorouter cipher suites:

1. In the **Networking** configuration screen of PAS, select either TLS v1.0 or v1.1 in the **Minimum version of TLS supported by HAProxy and Router field**.

1. Add one or more of the Gorouter-supported cipher suites listed in [TLS v1.0 and v1.1](#tls_10_11) to the existing list of default cipher suites in the **TLS Cipher Suites for Router** field.

For more information, see [Configuring PAS](../customizing/configure-pas.html).
