Choose the method the Gorouter uses to verify app identity under **Gorouter app identity verification**. To enable the Gorouter to verify app identity using TLS, select **The Gorouter uses TLS to verify app identity**. To enable the Gorouter and your apps to verify each other's identity using TLS, select **The Gorouter and apps use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**.
  	Verifying app identity using TLS or mutual TLS (mTLS) enables encryption between Gorouter and app containers and guards against misrouting during control plane failures. For more information about Gorouter route consistency modes, see [Preventing Misrouting](../concepts/http-routing.html#consistency) in _HTTP Routing_.

  	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>, you can enable app identification using TLS or mTLS in the <strong>Advanced Features</strong> pane of <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>.
