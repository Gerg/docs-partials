+ **TLS 1.2 is required even when the checkbox to restrict TLS 1.2 is unchecked**.
  If the single node and leader-follower service instances are upgraded, this may cause applications to fail to connect
  to the service instance if they don't support TLS 1.2 or use an old MySQL connector.
  (e.g. applications using mysql-connector/j older than 8.0.8 or 5.1.44 will fail). HA and Multi-Site instances are unaffected.
