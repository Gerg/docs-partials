* The backup that <%= vars.product_short %> creates is not 
being uploaded to s3 external storage. <%= vars.product_short %> 
does not configure the endpoint url and instead uses the 
default AWS endpoint.

  This issue impacts:
  - Amazon S3 buckets that use custom endpoints
  - Ceph storage clusters
  - Other S3-compatible endpoints certified by VMware


  To mitigate this issue, you can get the backup artifact, 
  manually upload the artifact to your external storage, 
  and clean the disk.
