* **<%= vars.product_short %> backups do not upload to s3 
external storage:** <%= vars.product_short %> 
does not configure the endpoint url and instead uses the 
default AWS endpoint.

  This issue impacts:
  - Amazon S3 buckets that use custom endpoints
  - Ceph storage clusters
  - Other S3-compatible endpoints certified by VMware

  To mitigate this issue, configure a different external storage option. 
  You can configure secure copy protocol (SCP), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or Azure Storage. For 
  more information about how to configure external storage, see [Backing up MySQL for Pivotal Platform](./backup.html).
