	<p><strong><%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.5 and earlier does 
		not support Multi-Site Replication:</strong> If you have 
		installed <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.5 or earlier, 
		operators cannot configure multiple foundations to be in 
		the same data center or spread across multiple data centers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Multi-Site Replication is not supported because the Cloud 
		Foundry API (CAPI) v3 is a dependency. CAPI v3 is introduced 
		in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.6 and later. To use 
		Multi-Site Replication, you must upgrade <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
